# yp-challenge
This git contains implementable python and jupyter notebook codes and benchmark datasets 

to learn how to recognize brain signals based on deep learning models (CNN /LSTM), 

it is associated with our mission to making a full astronauts communication and monitoring system 

using direct pathways between the brain's electrical activity and external mission devices (Brain computer interfaces).

Since we donâ€™t actually have the headset to collect brain signals we tested mini projects 

for emotional detection and speller on already available datasets and experiences. 

Our end goal is to use the actual brain signals of the astronaut to implement these codes.
